    "## Online Evaluation\n",
    "Using each offline evaluation metric, we create a subset of the data for which algorithm E always wins (delta > 0), effectively simulating a dataset where algorithm E is better than P. We now use this dataset to perform online evaluation on, which allows us to compare offline and online methods to see whether they agree. Since we have chosen datasets for which according to the offline metrics E is always better, one might expect that online evaluation will have similar results. However, this is not true for the Random Click Model, since it does not care about anything except for the overall click rate. Thus evaluation metric will contradict the offline evaluation metrics and assign equal wins to P and E. The Simple Dependent Click Model takes attractiveness into account, which we have assumed to be correlated to relevance. Thus, the SDCM will assign more clicks to documents originating from ranking E, resulting in a higher proportion of win for E. This is more in line with the offline evaluation metrics, although it is still a probabilistic click model and will, unlike the offline metrics, not assign all wins to E."
