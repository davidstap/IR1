    "\n",
    "Balance interleaving has been shown to be biased in a number of corner cases. An example was given during the lecture with two ranked lists of length 3 being interleaved, and a randomly clicking population of users that resulted in algorithm A winning ⅔ of the time, even though in theory the percentage of wins should be 50% for both algorithms. Can you come up with a situation of two ranked lists of length 3 and a distribution of clicks over them for which Team-draft interleaving is unfair to the better algorithm?\n"
